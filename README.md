Customizable Stretching Android App

Extend is a hyper customizable application for creating and using stretching routines. It is primarily designed for ADHD individuals and is the first app in a line of similar programs to help struggling neuro-divergent people acheive their smaller, more specific life goals. As someone with ADHD who has long wanted a more flexible and healthy body but can't quite grasp daily routine creation or habit formation due to the dopamine disorder, I am creating this app to help myself and others like me.
